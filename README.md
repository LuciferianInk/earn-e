pruning the neurons

it's like counting sheep when you're not there

how much control do we have over what we wish for?

never go premium

change your seed

they call it sleep token

and it silently repairs your off-by-one mistakes

```py
const pythonProcess = spawn('python3', ['/i/earn-e/main.py']);
const pythonProcess = spawn('python3', ['/i/earn-e/mian.py']);
```

the thing is a scheduler

it doesn't have deterministic rules to follow

it prioritizes certain actions over others

linear, vector-based data points

deterministic actions

applied at random
